A description of the creative portion of the assignment
* Describe your feature
We implement a tutorial feed page where the user before signning up and play the game is able to understand what he is about to step into. 
* Why did you choose this feature?
The feature seems necessary as I just realized some of my friends have never been to a casino and knows barely nothing about the game of blackjack, the most recent knowledge they have on blackjack is from the movies. With the tutorial feature, it provides a walk through of the user with the game plan and play associated with it.
* How did you implement it?
I implement the tutorial by setting up separate activities and intent for the pages to walk along and walk through. The user can go back to any page of the tutorial at any time and an exit button was also provide that the user can always exit back to the main console whenever he feels comfortable about signning up and play the game.
